# Open ELIoT
Central code repository for the Open ELIoT project.

## Code repositories

The project consists of standalone repositories for the hardware sensor node that collects environmental measurements, and the cloud IoT platform that stores and processes the data.

You can access the two projects through their submodules.

## Description and objectives

Damages from natural and man-made disasters such as floods, droughts and water pollution have increased significantly in recent years due to climate change, inadequate flood protection planning and irrational water management. At European level, the effects of floods and storms during 1998-09 as evident from the 213 recorded events, reached 1.126 human fatalities and €96bil. in economic losses. In terms of pollution, international surveys have shown that about 12.6 million people die annually from the effects of water, soil and air pollution. This negative impact could be significantly mitigated if timely and reliable information was made available through the monitoring of environmental parameters in water bodies.

In Greece, public and private operators regularly monitor local and / or national networks (e.g. Surface Water Surveillance Network according to the Water Framework Directive, 2000/60 / EU, http://wfd.ypeka.gr/).

However, the practice has significant limitations and weaknesses, which are related to the following:
* the cost of the process is very large, as it requires the transfer of qualified personnel to the sampling points, the use of special equipment and analysis in laboratories
* the time to results is long for the same reasons
many of the data have practical value at the time they are observed (and not later)
* the data density is very sparse and at national level the monitoring frequency often does not exceed three times a year (http://wfd.ypeka.gr/).

The subject of the proposed project is the implementation of an integrated and economically viable Internet of Things solution for the monitoring and analysis of environmental parameters regarding surface water. The solution extends from sensors (data acquisition) to the online data processing and analysis platform, which creates immediate added value for end-users, while the open architecture / approach to the project enhances its future sustainability.

Specific objectives of the project are:
* The development and integration of appropriate 'smart' open hardware sensors for remote monitoring of environmental parameters. The main features of the sensors are low cost, energy autonomy, portability, ease of installation and maintenance, and their technological superiority in data management and transmission.
* Creating an Internet of Things open source platform, which is the website for collecting, storing, processing, analyzing and displaying data. Based on open cloud technologies, it creates the platform for delivering Platform-as-a-Service solutions with scalable computing resources that can be customized to customer requirements to optimize economy and efficiency.
* The implementation of two pilot projects to confirm and highlight the added value of the infrastructure and service to be created.
* The creation of a community / ecosystem that can exploit and extend the use of the platform in areas in need beyond the project's pilot and ensure the viability of the platform over time.

The resulting solution provides the possibility of timely and clear information / warning on phenomena requiring immediate response, such as floods, droughts and water pollution, with a view to timely measures to reduce impacts. It is a value-added service and an essential, valuable decision support tool that helps protect Public Health and save resources.
